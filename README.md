# C Programming
I created this repository when i started to learn C.<br/>
C is a complex language which makes it hard to grasp all its concepts at a go.<br/>
I therefore decided to document my learning journey.<br/>
Every single concept I have learnt has been captured here.<br/>
<br/>
Anytime I need to revise anything, I move straight to this repo.<br/>
It is how I learn
